??? should I do these things:
	add Admin pages
		Admins need to be able to 
			delete users and all users data
			view, edit, and delete Users, Entries, Students, and Subjects
			see which User owns each Entry, Student, Subject
		here is some related code:
            var adminList = await _userManager.GetUsersInRoleAsync(Constants.AdminRoleName);
            if (adminList.Select(u => u.Id).Contains(userId))
            {
                Students = await _context.Students
                    .ToListAsync();
            }

FIX COOKIE POLICY - are cookies being used when the user has not yet accepted cookies?

need more consistent error logging and handling

add Admin pages
	confirm email addresses manually
	resend confirmation email
	delete users and all users data
	see all data
	here is some related code:
            var adminList = await _userManager.GetUsersInRoleAsync(Constants.AdminRoleName);
            if (adminList.Select(u => u.Id).Contains(userId))
            {
                Students = await _context.Students
                    .ToListAsync();
            }
	
Reconsider the links that are on each page - decide which really need to be there and which do not

grades
	add error handling to all grades pages
	rework responsive design for all grades pages (possibly ALL pages)
	entries in full report should include grades 
		and should also mirror the entry details page
	entries in brief report maybe should include grades
	also include a points report - choose date range, subjects, and students
		for each student, list all subjects chosen
		for each subject, list points earned, points available, and percentage of points
	include grades in data download as well

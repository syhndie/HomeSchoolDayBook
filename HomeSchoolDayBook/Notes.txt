	right now the application is broken because line 76 in Login.cshtml.cs always returns false
		even when email and password entered matches email and password registered with
		here is the line: 
			var result = await _signInManager.PasswordSignInAsync(Input.Email, Input.Password, Input.RememberMe, lockoutOnFailure: true);
	another issue that may or may not be related is that IIS Express runs four applications whenever it runs HomeschoolDayBook.
		look in launchSettings.json, lines 6-7
		also note documents/visual studio 2017/projects/homeschooldaybook/.vs/config/applicationhost.config, lines 160-170



??? should I do these things:
	add Admin pages
		Admins need to be able to 
			view, edit, and delete Users, Entries, Students, and Subjects
			see which User owns each Entry, Student, Subject
		here is some related code:
            var adminList = await _userManager.GetUsersInRoleAsync(Constants.AdminRoleName);
            if (adminList.Select(u => u.Id).Contains(userId))
            {
                Students = await _context.Students
                    .ToListAsync();
            }

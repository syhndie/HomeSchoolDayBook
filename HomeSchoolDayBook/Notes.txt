section that covers navbar asking user to accept cookie and privacy policy or to get more info
	right now it has "use this section to" wording
privacy policy page

problem - when user changes email address, it changes immediately rather than after the user has confirmed new email
	find out how to change identity user model

should there be a link on the login page to resend confirmation email, in case user loses first one?
	after 24 hours, delete any unconfirmed account - note in confirmation email - this allows user to start registration over

??? should I do these things:
	add Admin pages
		Admins need to be able to 
			confirm email addresses manually
			resend confirmation email?
			delete users and all users data
			view, edit, and delete Users, Entries, Students, and Subjects
			see which User owns each Entry, Student, Subject
		here is some related code:
            var adminList = await _userManager.GetUsersInRoleAsync(Constants.AdminRoleName);
            if (adminList.Select(u => u.Id).Contains(userId))
            {
                Students = await _context.Students
                    .ToListAsync();
            }

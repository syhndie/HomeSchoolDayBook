talk to Matt??? - when adding a new entry, if you type in some grades, then add or remove a student or subject, it clears the grades you entered

entries in brief report has overlapping columns on small sized screens and on printing

grades for individual entries page has a horizontal scroll bar on small sized screens

sometimes subject grades and student grades has a horizontal scroll bar on small-sized screens
	this seems to be when you navigate to the page from the individual entries page, and you are on a small screen before you navigate

tables on student grades and suject grades pages say "entries" in some places rather than "grades"

need to order by entryid on data downloads (entries and grades)

need to clearly state that entry download does not include grades

are cookies being used when the user has not yet accepted cookies?

need more consistent error logging and handling

enable logger ????

add transcripts reports ????

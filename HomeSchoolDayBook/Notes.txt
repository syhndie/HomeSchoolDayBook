limit number of verification emails user can send

after 24 hours, delete any unconfirmed account - note in confirmation email - this allows user to start registration over

error, status, confirmed, etc. messages are all over the place - need to be standardized

??? should I do these things:
	add Admin pages
		Admins need to be able to 
			confirm email addresses manually
			resend confirmation email?
			delete users and all users data
			view, edit, and delete Users, Entries, Students, and Subjects
			see which User owns each Entry, Student, Subject
		here is some related code:
            var adminList = await _userManager.GetUsersInRoleAsync(Constants.AdminRoleName);
            if (adminList.Select(u => u.Id).Contains(userId))
            {
                Students = await _context.Students
                    .ToListAsync();
            }

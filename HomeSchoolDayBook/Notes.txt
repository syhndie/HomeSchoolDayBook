In the entry model, the upper range for hours is 24, and the upper range for minutes is 1,440. This seemed a logical upper limit, but if a user 
enters over half that in EACH field (hours and minutes) then on entry edit, it is invalid, because the program converts the minutes into hours
and adds them to the entered hours, which is too many
	
home page looks terrible on small screens - need to get rid of pic on smalls?

form fields all messed up and horizontal scroll bars on small screens for
	entries page
	subject grades page
	student grades page
	grades for individual entries page

sometimes subject grades and student grades has a horizontal scroll bar on small-sized screens
	this seems to be when you navigate to the page from the individual entries page, and you are on a small screen before you navigate

tables on student grades and suject grades pages say "entries" in some places rather than "grades"

need to order by entryid on data downloads (entries and grades)

need to clearly state that entry download does not include grades

are cookies being used when the user has not yet accepted cookies?

need more consistent error logging and handling

enable logger ????

add transcripts reports ????

when adding a new entry, if you type in some grades, then add or remove a student or subject, it clears the grades you entered
this can be changed, but wait and see if it seems important enough to pursue

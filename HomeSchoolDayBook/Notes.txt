need more consistent error logging and handling

add Admin pages
	confirm email addresses manually
	resend confirmation email
	delete users and all users data
	see all data
	here is some related code:
            var adminList = await _userManager.GetUsersInRoleAsync(Constants.AdminRoleName);
            if (adminList.Select(u => u.Id).Contains(userId))
            {
                Students = await _context.Students
                    .ToListAsync();
            }
	
Reconsider the links that are on each page - decide which really need to be there and which do not

grades
	add error handling to all grades pages
	rework responsive design for all grades pages (possibly ALL pages)
	include grades in data download as well
	add subject grade page that is accessible by link from My Subjects
	FIX EntriesInFull Report - it looks like ass when printed

add date range to download data form so users can download chunks of their data rather than all or noe

In the entry model, the upper range for hours is 24, and the upper range for minutes is 1,440. This seemed a logical upper limit, but if a user 
enters over half that in EACH field (hours and minutes) then on entry edit, it is invalid, because the program converts the minutes into hours
and adds them to the entered hours, which is too many

need more consistent error logging and handling

enable logger ????

add transcripts reports ????

when adding a new entry, if you type in some grades, then add or remove a student or subject, it clears the grades you entered
this can be changed, but wait and see if it seems important enough to pursue

add Admin pages

	here is some related code:

            var adminList = await _userManager.GetUsersInRoleAsync(Constants.AdminRoleName);

            if (adminList.Select(u => u.Id).Contains(userId))
            {
                Students = await _context.Students
                    .ToListAsync();
            }

Admins need to be able to:
	view, edit, and delete Users, Entries, Students, and Subjects
	see which User owns each Entry, Student, Subject

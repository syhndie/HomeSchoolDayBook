need to update content of 
	homepage - dashboard style?
	login
	register
need add checkboxes to hide inactive students/subjects



??? should I do these things:
	add Admin pages
		Admins need to be able to 
			view, edit, and delete Users, Entries, Students, and Subjects
			see which User owns each Entry, Student, Subject
		here is some related code:
            var adminList = await _userManager.GetUsersInRoleAsync(Constants.AdminRoleName);
            if (adminList.Select(u => u.Id).Contains(userId))
            {
                Students = await _context.Students
                    .ToListAsync();
            }

problem -
don't let users try to change email address to one already in the database!!!!!!!!

should there be a link on the login page to resend confirmation email, in case user loses first one?
	after 24 hours, delete any unconfirmed account - note in confirmation email - this allows user to start registration over

??? should I do these things:
	add Admin pages
		Admins need to be able to 
			confirm email addresses manually
			resend confirmation email?
			delete users and all users data
			view, edit, and delete Users, Entries, Students, and Subjects
			see which User owns each Entry, Student, Subject
		here is some related code:
            var adminList = await _userManager.GetUsersInRoleAsync(Constants.AdminRoleName);
            if (adminList.Select(u => u.Id).Contains(userId))
            {
                Students = await _context.Students
                    .ToListAsync();
            }
